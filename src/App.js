        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer and Unity Developer with over 5 years of experience in creating engaging games and tools. My expertise spans across mobile and WebGL platforms, and I have been involved in numerous projects that focus on delivering immersive gameplay experiences. I have worked on both 2D and 3D games, and my skill set includes Unity, C#, and various game development tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my development skills, I am experienced in building custom tools that streamline workflows and improve production pipelines. I am proficient in Git for version control, Jenkins and Bitrise for continuous integration, and Jira/Confluence for project management. I thrive in collaborative environments, always aiming to deliver polished, optimized, and high-performance products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently working remotely, I am open to relocation and excited to explore opportunities, especially within teams that are working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of game or product experiences.
